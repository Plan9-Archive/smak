SMAK is another image gallery app for werc.

To enable it, add:

	conf_enable_smak

to _werc/config in the dir with the image gallery.

It uses the p9p tools to convert the images (bmp,
jpg and png to read input files; resample and topng
to transform and write them). If the value of the
convert_cmd is set to $imagemagick_convert_cmd in
the config file, the ImageMagick tools will be used
instead. The _werc directory has to be writable by
the web server.

To configure SMAK to your taste, modifying the tpl
files should be enough. The functions give results
in different lines, so they can be processed with
common filters. To add content to a directory index
use the index.md file.
