SMAK is another image gallery app for werc.

To enable it, add:

	conf_enable_smak

to _werc/config in the dir with the image gallery.

It uses the ImageMagick tools. The _werc directory
has to be writable by the web server.

To configure SMAK to your taste, modifying the tpl
files should be enough. The functions give results
in different lines, so they can be processed with
common filters. To add content to a directory index
use the index.md file.
