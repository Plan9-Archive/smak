SMAK is another image gallery app for werc.

To enable it, add:

	conf_enable_smak

to _werc/config in the dir with the image gallery.

After enabling the app, some variables can be
configured:

   - extensions=(png jpg jpeg bmp)
   - prev_width=420
   - thumb_height=96

It uses the p9p tools to convert the images (bmp,
jpg and png to read input files; resample and topng
to transform and write them).

The _werc directory has to be writable by the
web server.

To configure SMAK to your taste, modifying the tpl
files should be enough.
