SMAK is another image gallery app for werc.
(by JGL.yiyus 2009)

To enable it, add:

	conf_enable_smak

to _werc/config in the dir with the image gallery.

To configure SMAK to your taste, set this variables:

   - smak_extensions=(png jpg jpeg bmp gif)
   - smak_prev_width=420
   - smak_thumb_height=96

for further customizations, modify the tpl files.

It uses the p9p tools to convert the images (bmp,
jpg, png and gif to read input files; resample and
topng to transform and write them).

The _werc directory has to be writable by the
web server.
